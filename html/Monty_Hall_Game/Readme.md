## Monty Hall Game 
 
 Let's practice our linking webpages skills by making a game
 show website where visitors win prizes if they choose the right
 options.

 We already have mulitple files. Aside form the homepage, each 
 webpage has an image, text, and a reset button for the prize 
 behind each door.
